Some fun little crypto trading scripts I threw together during the great Ether craze of '16

- coinTrader.py: 
 - Looks for large price swings as a result of the US going to sleep and China waking up, hoping to catch reactionary changes and bet against them, since they almost always reverse.
 - Performs some really basic Arbitrage trading between two exchanges
- crawler.py:
 - Proof of concept script to look for patterns over time in the content of reddit comments, trading on overall community confidence.
